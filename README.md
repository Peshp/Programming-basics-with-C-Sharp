# Programming-basics-with-C-
Programming basics with C# is the first course in SoftUni, which aims to introduce us to programming and teach us the most basic things, and throughout the course we work on project tasks and at the end have exam.

In the Programming basics with C# course, we work with Visual Studio and look at the following topics:
1. First steps in coding
- This is the first lecture that aims to show us data types and variables

2. Conditional Statements
- This is the second lecture that aims to show us how to work with if-else conditionals.

3. Conditional Statements Advanced
= This lecture shows us how to work with nested if-else conditionals and switch-case conditionals.

4. For Loop
- This lecture introduces us to the workings of the for loop.

5. While loop

6. Nested loop
